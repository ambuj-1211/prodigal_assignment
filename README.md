2. If not using conda directly jump to step 5.
3. create environment using `conda env create -f environment.yaml`
4. activate environment using `conda activate prodigal_venv`
5. after activating the environment use pip to download dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. create .env file and add the following to it `GROQ_API_KEY="Your_API_Key_here"`
7. get your groq api key from the groq dashboard.
8. Run the code using `streamlit run app.py` for the main app.
